In this small project i will try to create a web with a few recipes made just with HMTL right now.

I will demostrate with this proyect that:

  I know the use of the basic coding of HTML.
  I know to organice the differents file I will create with this project.
  I know to use the git commit in a good manere to create good habits of work.

After I finished this proyect I will review it and save for futere things like introduce CCS code.
